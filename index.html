            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>If you're here, this is probably the first question you'll be asking.<br>I'm Miguel, I'm 26 and I'm from Portugal. I've moved to Manchester to pursue a career as a Nuclear Medicine Technologist.</p>
            <h3>How I got into code?</h3>
            <p>Easy. I was bored. Yes, that's right. There is no exciting story about how I found myself on the verge of a breaking down and in need to change my life completely, and how code save it. Basically, while at work, I did my normal duties and then found myself with a few empty hours before the end of my shift, which bored me to dead. I started having a look into options of what to learn next.</p>
            <p>I've always felt that my job took away my creative side, which was were I could excel. And, to be honest, I was very eager to bring it back.</p>
